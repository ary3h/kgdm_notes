==== Technology
I feel that the drive of most of our technological pursuits is not kingdom minded.
We look to often solve convenience issues and not real fundamental issues.
But then again, what can one expect from the World that does not have a kingdom mindset.
New focus for developing technology:

* To help mankind live more fulfilling and prospering lives
* To help mankind steward the earth so that we can honour our mandate from the Lord
