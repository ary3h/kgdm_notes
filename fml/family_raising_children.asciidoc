== Raising children

=== General Principles
* Children need boundaries that you purposefully expand over time with the acceptance of new resp. from your child.
* Discipline should be done in love, with a focus on developing self-control and encouraging intrinsic motivation

=== ToDo
==== Outsourcing

===== Outsourcing the womb
* Example in scripture of Abraham, Sarah and their Egyptian slave.
* The positives these days...
  * This could be done without the man and surrogate have intimate relations

===== Outsourcing parenting
Nowadays many couples both have careers.
Is it OK to ask other people to nurse, raise, educate... your children?
How much is too much?

==== Education

===== Responding to poor grades
* *You can't learn for your kids!*
** But you can...
*** Set an example in living responsibly
*** Create a safe and calm environment that encourages studying
*** Look for ways to provide the best instruction
*** Show and live out an excitement for learning
* *You can't control their every move / action*
** In fact don't even try! You will either create a dependant robot or rebel
** Showing empathy is a much more effective approach to helping children overcome their challenges
** Frustration and shouting makes things worse
** Research has shown that warmth / empathy is linked to higher achievement and better behaviour
* *Many successful people struggled with grades*
** e.g. Einstein, Ford...
** Focus on nurturing good character, curiosity and problem-solving skills
* *Respond with sincere love & concern*
** How you could respond...
*** I guess these grades are disappointing for you. Is there any way I can help? Remember this doesn't affect my love for you! I love you so much.
