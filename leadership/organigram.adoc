=== Organigram
In Joshua ?? they find out who sinned and they go through several layers...

- Tribe
- Clan
- Household
- Family
- Person

So I old recommend every Nation / Organization should not exceed 7 layers...

1. All Nations and People's under Jesus as King
2. Nation / Organization
3. Tribe
4. Clan
5. Household - Extended Family
6. Nuclear Family
7. Person
