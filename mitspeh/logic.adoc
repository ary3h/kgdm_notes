== Logic
* We have experienced the beenfits of logic in the technologies it has enabled us to build
* However we have seen the limits of logic that have led to relativism as people realize they cannot figure it all out using logic as a tool
* This is why absolute truth can not be found in a system, but only in a person... the one who created everything: Jesus!
