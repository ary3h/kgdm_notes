* Realising Spiritual Poverty, hungering for the Kingdom
** Yes, the term "poor in spirit" as used in the Bible, particularly in the context of the Beatitudes, encompasses not only material poverty but also spiritual humility and a recognition of one's need for God. Being "poor in spirit" implies a deep sense of spiritual dependence, a humble acknowledgment of one's own inadequacy, and a hunger for righteousness and understanding of the kingdom of God.
** So, yes, the phrase can be understood to include a hunger for spiritual knowledge, a desire to learn about and align oneself with the principles of the kingdom of God. It reflects a heart that is open, receptive, and seeking a relationship with God and a deeper understanding of His ways.
