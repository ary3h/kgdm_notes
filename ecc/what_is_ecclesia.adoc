=== What is Ecclesia (Church)?

==== Introduction
* The Church is not about people, but about Elohim
* The Church is made up of people who are focused on Elohim!

==== Matthew 18:20 - Jesus needs to be there
> 20  For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there I am in the middle of them.”
> -- Matthew 18:20 (WEB)

* If Jesus is not in the Church, it's not Church
* Many people start some sort of "christian" organization, but only RUACH can build His Church
