=== Scaling Ecclesia (Church)

=== Current State
* A lot of our energy goes into...
** running and arranging internal events
** building buildings
* So much so that most people spend their free time attending these events instead of...
** Building real relationships
** Reaching out to their community and those who don't now Jesus

=== Goals
* Scale Laterally & Not Horizontally
** Is this how the Jesus & the early Ecclesia built?

=== Analysis
=== Problems / Issues / Challenges
* I have the feeling people are often Christian event groupies and not disciples

==== Questions
* What is the actual purpose of us meeting together?
* We don't know any other way?
* This could be the way the Lord wants us to build?
** Are we too focused on: power, prestige etc.??
==== Learnings
* *Start a Home Ecclesia movement*
** Pro's
*** Don't waste time and energy on facilities
*** Scales well
*** Helps to nurture close relationships
** Con's
*** Can become too focused on itself
*** Can become theologically unsound if there are no other external positive influences
*** Not enough people to build momentum (a movement)
* *Keep the main structure the same, but organize it differently*
** Place a lot of focus on small groups being led by Fathers & Mothers in the Ecclesia

=== Options
* Build an online community to help people to feel like they are not alone in what they are doing...?
** With regular local meetups etc.?
* Focus on Intensive Discipleship as a basis?
** You have to live this yourself?
