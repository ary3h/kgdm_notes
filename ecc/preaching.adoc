==== Ted Talks Notes
* Make clear Your purpose on stage is to give people a gift
** Don't promote me and my thing...
* If they knew it would make a difference for them
* Different knowledge becomes different lives later

==== DoD / Important Check
* Does the sermon have a clear focus
* Do you move people from information to encountering God in a new way?
** What are the steps like Jacob's ladder leading people into the Throne Room?
* Is there a single word Hebrew / Greek form the Bibile that can encapsulate your message?
