=== Husbands & Wives

==== Key Points
* We are both made in the image of God
* A husband and his wife are a perfect, complete image of God
** The image we represent is that of Christ and his Ecclesia

==== Vision
* Though a man is the head and carries the responsibility of setting the direction of the marriage and the family
* It is important that models his leadership on Christ who calls his bride to come up to him and co-reign with him (<<ephesians>>).
