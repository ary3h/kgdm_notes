== Initial effects of God's Word

=== Introduction
* Hebrews 4:12 - Word living and powerful
** Greek word "energetic" (intense, vibrant...)
* John 6:63 - Words I speak are Spirit & life
* 1 Thess. 3:12 - Word wroks effectively in believers
* God's Word is not just marks or sounds, but it is alive, accomplishing His will in conjunction with the Spirit

=== Effect is determined by response
* Effect of Word is based on how people respond to it in any context
* James 1:21 - lay aside filthiness and naughtiness and receive Word with meekness
** Filthiness - perverse delight in licentiousness and impurity
** Naughtiness - refusing to accept instruction or correction (like child)
*** Romans 9:20 - answer back to God
*** Job 40:2 - Don't correct / answer back to the Lord unless you want to answer for it...
** Both close heart and mind to the beneficial effects of God'S Word.
* Meekness (opposite attitude) - fear of the Lord (reverance and respect)
** Humility, Sincerity, Patience, Openess (Mind & Heart) Quietness
** Psalm 25:8-9,12,14 - Description of Man able to receive instruction & blessing from the Lord
* In summary Word is active and has different effect on people based on how it is received
* Like the Gospel which also divides based on how people respond (1 Cor. 1:18)
* Word is sharp (Heb. 4:12) in that it also divides people into two classes (rejecters & receivers)
* Matthew 10:34-35 - Jesus did not come to bring peace, but a sword...
** Will sever the closest of earthly bonds

=== Faith
* For those who reeive the word with openenss, meekness etc.
* Various effects
* Romans 10:17 - Faith is produced
* 3 steps
** Logos
** Hear - focused attention / aroused interest
** Faith
* Without real interest described by hearing, faith will not be produced
* Hearing starts a process in your inner being that takes time to develop
** Why so many christians lack real faith - don't devote time to hearing
*** If time dedicated to the study of the Word it is done haphazardly and hurriedly
*** All over before faith has had time to develop
