== Jesus Christ the Foundation of the Christian Faith
=== Believer’s life the construction of a Building
* Examples:
** Jude vs. 20
** 1 Corinthians 3:9-10
** Ephesians 2:22
** Acts 20:32
* Natural Order - You first need to lay a foundation before you can build
** Spiritual order is similar
* You can only support a small building on a weak foundation
** Similarly, a strong foundation can support larger buildings
* Many christians struggle with the following:
** Start off with grand plans,
*** but because they do not build a strong foundation,
*** their building ends up in a heap of ruins (unanswered, prayers, vows and intentions unfulfilled…)
*** The real problem lies beneath the ruins
**** A poor foundation was laid
* My Testimony
** I have been following Jesus for many years now, but I must admit when I look back I did not build a strong foundation
** I spent a lot of time doing things for Elohim, and I built my life in a very haphazard, sporadic, Bedouin way
** I was very unstable accordingly and my life was filled with doubt
** I should have spent more time building a strong foundation
*** instead of trying to always be the big spiritual leader...
**** present at every event,
**** always looking to pioneer something new etc.

=== Christ the Rock
* Accordingly, we should ask ourselves the following question…
** What is Elohim’s appointed foundation on which we should build our christian life?
* Jesus Christ is the foundation!
** 1 Corinthians 3:11
** 1 Peter 2:6
*** Isaiah 28:16 (showing the Old & New Testament agree in this fact)
* Nothing else can be the foundation!
** Creeds
** Denominations
** Traditions
** Church
** Ordinance
** Ceremony
* Matthew 16:13-18
** Some mistakenly believe Jesus is saying He will build his Church upon Peter
*** This is nonsense!
*** Petros - small rock
*** Peter was just a man with many failings even though a charismatic, born leader
**** Matthew 16:22-23 - Get behind me satan
**** Denied the Lord 3 times
**** Galatians 2:11-14 - Separated himself because of the fear of the Judaizers
*** Rather consider…
**** Psalm 18:2 - The Lord is my rock
**** Psalm 62 - He only is my rock and my salvation
***** Rock - 3 times
***** Salvation - 4 times
**** ONLY - Only the Lord!
**** Acts 4:12 - Peter himself says,”Nor is there salvation in any other…”

=== How do we build on Jesus the rock?
* 4 Stages seen in Matthew 16:16
** Confrontation
*** You need a definite, personal experience with Jesus
*** No mediator or any other human being playing a go between
*** No basing your faith on someone’s nice ideas, emotions etc.
*** Testimony
**** When I was 7 years old I attended a School for children at a Rhema conference where they told me about Jesus and what he had done for me. This was not the first time I had heard about Jesus, but this time I really felt I needed to respond to the message. I remember, later at home, holding this pamphlet in my hands with a picture of Jesus on the cross and appreciating what Jesus had done for me as well as being in a repentant state
**** I also remember a dream one night where Jesus came on a chariot to fetch people and he spoke to me and said one day He would come and fetch me, but in the meantime I was to commit myself to His Word!
** Revelation
** Acknowledgement
** Confession
