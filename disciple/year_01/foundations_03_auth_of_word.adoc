==== Introduction
> 34 Jesus answered them, “Isn’t it written in your law, ‘I said, you are gods’?
>
> 35  If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture can’t be broken),
>
> 36  do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, ‘You blaspheme,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’?
> -- John 10:34-36

* 2 titles used for the Bible
** The Word of God
*** Jesus was saying the truths revealed are not from man, but from God
*** Men are only channels
** The second: Scripture - explained below
*** That which is written

==== The Bible - God's written Word
* The scripture
** Reveals its constraints (Divinely appointed limitation of the Bible)
** Means: "That which is written"
** Does not contain the entirety of all of His thoughts, of what God has said and done, His purposes etc.
*** That is it doe not contain every detail
** Also doesn't contain all the divinely inspired messages given through humans
*** Not all utterances of the prophets mentioned were recorded in the Bible
*** Bible states this (John... if all that Jesus did was recorded...)
* Though the Bible is completely true and authoritative, it is highly selective!
* Message primarily for the human race
** Expressed in words we can understand
** Centrla theme is man's wellbeing
** Shows how man has sinned and fallen and can be restored through the faith in the finished work of Jesus
* Jesus sets approval upon the Bible's claims for supreme and divine authority
** "Scripture cannot be broken"
* Men were only channels when they wrote these books
** These days we are able to control satelllites millions of miles away with radio waves we cannot see
*** Only people with the most unscientific minds would reject the idea God could not do this with His creation

==== Inspired by the Holy Spirit
> 16 Every Scripture is God-breathed and† profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness,
> 17 that each person who belongs to God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.
> -- 2 Timothy 3:16-17 WEB

* The Bible clearly describes how God directed and communciated with the people who wrote the scriptures
** through the Holy Spirit (2 Timothy 3:16)
*** By inspiration - means literally "inbreathed of God" - connected with word Spirit
** 2 Peter 1:20-21
*** "Moved by" - "Borne along by / Directed in their course by"
* Psalm 12:6
** Furnace - human vessel
** Silver tried 7 times - absolute perfection of the Holy Spirit's Work

==== Eternal, Authoritative
* Psalm 119:89 - Forever, Word, Settled in Heavn
* Bible product of eternity and not time
* Eternal counsel and mind of God
* Matthew 24:35 - My words will not pass away
* Psalm 119: 160 - entirety of your Word is truth
* Jesus, Disciples and all Jews of the time accepted entirety of OT scripture as authoritative
* Matthew 4:1-10 Jesus quoted scripture to defeat the enemy (It is written...)
* Matthew 5:17-18
* Jot - smallest letter in the Hebrew Alphabet
* Tittle - small curve added to the ends of letters
* Jesus saying not one bit of His Word will be corrupted or pass away (be of no use)
* Other examples
** Matthew 19:4
** Matthew 22:32 (Exodus 3:6 - Jesus saying still valid today)
* Entire life of Jesus was directed in every aspect by the Scriptures
* If the OT scriptures are not absoloutely accurate or authoritative then Jesus was a lier or deluded
