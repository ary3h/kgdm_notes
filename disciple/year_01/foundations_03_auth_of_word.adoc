* https://www.ancient-hebrew.org/studies-words/what-is-torah.htm

==== Introduction
* John 10:34-36
* Title for the Bible
** The Word of God
*** jesus was saying the truths revelaed are not form man, but from God
*** Men are only channels
* The Scripture

==== The Bible - God's written Word
* The scripture reveals a constraint
** That which is written
** Does not contain the entirety of what God has done, all of His thoughts, purpose etc. in every detail
** Also doesn't contain all the divinely inspired messages
*** Bible states this (John... if all that jesus did was recorded...)
* Bible is completely true and authoritative, but highly selective
* Message primarily for the human race
* Scripture cannot be broken
** Jesus sets approval upon its claims for supreme and divine authority
* Men were only channels when they wrote these books
** These days we are able to control satelllites millions of miles away with radio waves we cannot see
*** Only people with the most unscientific minds would reject the idea God could not do this with His creation

==== Inspired by the Holy Spirit
* The Bible clearly describes how God controlled, directed and communciated with the people who wrote the scriptures
** 2 Timothy 3:16 - through the Holy Spirit
*** By inspiration - means literally "inbreathed of God" - connected with word Spirit
** 2 Peter 1:20-21
*** "Moved by" - "Borne along by / Directed in their course by"
* Psalm 12:6
** Furnace - human vessel
** Silver tried 7 times - absolute perfection of the Holy Spirit's Work

==== Eternal, Authoritative
* Psalm 119:89 - Forever, Word, Settled in Heavn
* Bible product of eternity and not time
* Eternal counsel and mind of God
* Matthew 24:35 - My words will not pass away
* Psalm 119: 160 - entirety of your Word is truth
* Jesus, Disciples and all Jews of the time accepted entirety of OT scripture as authoritative
* Matthew 4:1-10 Jesus quoted scripture to defeat the enemy (It is written...)
* Matthew 5:17-18
* Jot - smallest letter in the Hebrew Alphabet
* Tittle - small curve added to the ends of letters
* Jesus saying not one bit of His Word will be corrupted or pass away (be of no use)
* Other examples
** Matthew 19:4
** Matthew 22:32 (Exodus 3:6 - Jesus saying still valid today)
* Entire life of Jesus was directed in every aspect by the Scriptures
* If the OT scriptures are not absoloutely accurate or authoritative then Jesus was a lier or deluded

* New Testament Authority
* Matthew 28:19-20 - teaching them to obey...
* Matthew 23:34 - Jesus intended for his teachings to be set down in writing
