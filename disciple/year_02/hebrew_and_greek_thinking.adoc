== Hebrew & Greek Thinking

=== Conclusions
* hebrew thinking focuses on right action and right emotions / feelings
* Greek thinking focuses on thinking right
* Both together with the guidance of the Trinity lead to wholeness in humanity
* HOWEVER, if we only develop in one type of thinking...
** We can become lopsided!
** We can cut ourselves off from faith-filled living that leads to action (only greek logic)
** We can become esoteric (gnosticism) and live in a worlf of fantasy that may be interesting, but lead to muddled thinking
* Only through Yeshua can we enter into true wholeness
** He leads the way and empowers us into right thinking, feeling and action through Ruach
