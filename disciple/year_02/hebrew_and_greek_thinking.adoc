== Hebrew & Greek Thinking

=== Conclusions
* Hebrew thinking
** focuses on right action and right emotions / feelings
** More practical and relationally focused
* Greek thinking
** focuses on thinking right
** Abstracts
** Correctness
** Knowledge
* Both together with the guidance of the Trinity lead to wholeness in humanity
* HOWEVER, if we only develop in one type of thinking...
** We can become lopsided!
** We can cut ourselves off from faith-filled living that leads to action (only greek logic)
** We can become esoteric (gnosticism) and live in a worlf of fantasy that may be interesting, but lead to muddled thinking
* Only through Yeshua can we enter into true wholeness
** He leads the way and empowers us into right thinking, feeling and action through Ruach working with Yeshua (Rhema & Logos & Logos Sarx Gegonen)
