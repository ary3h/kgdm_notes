== Absolute Truth

=== Postmodernism
* Claims that absolute truth cannot be known
* Claims people are too influenced by their context to have / know any final truth
* Problem is that there is a logical error here in that saying you cannot know truth is in and of itself a "truth"
* If you were "true" to postmodern ideals you would have to test every single thing, every single day (e.g. is the floor level?) as you would not be able to trust anything you unconciously believe to be true
* In the history of the sciences we see how our better understanding of the truths of the physical world is the basis for the world in which we live today

=== Relativism
* Ethical Relativism
** There are no universal moral values
** Unlike postmodernism which states we cannot know truth
*** Relativism claims that no moral truths exist
