== Jesus the Foundation

=== Introduction
* Assuming you have laid a foundation of a personal encounter
* How do you continue to build on the foundation?
* Matthew 7:24-27
** Parable of the wise & foolish builder
** Whoever hears these sayings of mine and does them...
** I will "aliken"/compare him to someone who built their house on a rock
** Notice same tests for both
** No storm free passage to heaven (Acts 14:22)

=== Build by doing what the Bible says
* Matthew 7:24
** Building on the rock means listening & acting on what the Bible says
** The Bible is are the Words of Jesus
** We need to be diligent in hearing and doing the Word of Elohim
* DP says Acts 20:32 is an example, but this is taken out of context
** this verse refers to the Gospel
** However the gospel is explained and found in the Bible
* The Bible - God's Word
** As we read, listen to and act on it
** We grow in our faith
** It builds a strong fortress of faith in our lives founded on Jesus Christ
* What is the relationship between the Bible and Jesus?
** Both are referred to as the Word of God and seem interchangeable
*** John 1:1
*** John 1:14
*** Rev. 19:13
** Name identity reveal nature identity
** Both are a divine, authoritative, perfect revelation of God
** They agree perfectly with each other and reveal eacah other perfectly
** Bible = written Word
** Christ = personal Word
*** Before incarnation Christ was the Eternal Word with Abba
*** In incarnation He was the Word made flesh
*** Ruach reveals God through the written Word and through the eternal Word made flesh: Jesus

=== Discipleship Test / Proof
* If Jesus & The Bible are so deeply one...
** Therefore our relationship with the Word needs to be similar to that with Jesus
** Both are to be cherished, obeyed, treated with repect and loved
** John 14
*** Disciples are sad Jesus is going
*** He says they will have a new relationship with Him and will still see Him
*** The other Judas asks how will He manifest (communicate etc.) himself to them?
*** John 14:23 - If anyone loves me, he will keep My word & the Father & Jesus will come and make their home with him
**** A true disciple keeps Jesus' word (the Bible)
**** Four key points from Jesus' statement
***** 1. Keeping the Word distinguishes a disciple from the world
***** 2. Keeping the word is the supreme test of a disciple's love for Elohim (and cause of favour)
***** 3. Jesus manifests himself through His Word as it is kept & obeyed
***** 4. Abba & Yeshua come into a disciples life and make their home there through the Word

=== Love Test
* 1 John 2:4-5
** He who keeps His Word is one in whom the love of God is perfected
* Your attitude towards the Word is your attitude towards Elohim
* You don't ... Elohim more than you ... the written Word
** love
** obey
** honour
** have have more room in your heart for ... have room for
* God only means so much to you as what his Word means to you

=== Means of Revelation
* Acts 2:17 - We are living in this age
* 1 Thess. 5:19-21
* Don't quench or despise, but we are called to test
* Test the Spirits...
* Isaiah 8:20
* Whatever the Spirit speaks in this time needs to be tested with the written Word
** The Written Word is the Supreme Standard
* Nobody, Church, Institution etc. has authority to deviate from the Word
** Otherwise they are in darkness
* Matthew 24:23-25 - Jesus warns about false prophets
* Look how people in the Church are twisting the Word to accept sexual perversion and the destruction of gender
** e.g. Many Denominations - Lutherans, Anglicans...
* 1 Timothy 4:1-3 - Another warning
** Warnings about aceticism in regard to diet and marriage
** Those who know the Word will be safeguarded
* Psalm 33:6
** Elohim's Word and Ruach will always work together in perfect harmony
** When we speak breath and words go out, so is it with Elohim
** Genesis 1:2
** As He spoke, the Breath of God (Ruach) went out with His words to bring about creation
** Never divorce these two (e.g. Academics and Esoterics)
*** Word without Ruach - Dead, powerless religion
*** Ruach without Word - Fanaticism, weird spirituality, silliness
