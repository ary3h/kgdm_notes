== Jesus the Foundation

=== Introduction
In this section we will see that we cannot build our faith on any other foundation,
other than Jesus. We also cannot mix Jesus with any other religions or philosophies:
He stands alone as the only foundation for our faith and the only door way to the Godhead.

* There is no other way to be right with Yahweh outside of Jesus
* There is no other way to re-establish relationship with Yahweh except through Jesus
* There is no other way into Heaven except through Jesus

=== The Bible
* Over 1 billion people worldwide call themselves followers of Jesus
** Identify with the Christian Faith
* Most agree that the Bible is the authoritative basis of their faith and how they practice it
* The Bible is considered important in 2 other major world religions: Judaism & Islam
* It is the most read and influential book
* Anyone seeking a good general cannot ignore reading the Bible
* Has profoundly influenced Western Culture
* Two major sections:
** Old Testament (OT)
*** 39 books
*** Primarily written in Hebrew (some parts in Aramaic)
*** Main flow of the OT "Story"
**** Creation, Adam & Eve, Fall of Man, Promise to restore
**** Abraham and start of Nation of Israel
**** Promise that Elohim will redeem mankind through the Abrahamic lineage
**** Describes God’s dealings with the nation of Israel over roughly 2000 years and how he is preparing the world for the coming messiah who will redeem mankind
***** Individuals & Nation
***** Judgements & Justice
***** Wisdom & Power

** New Testament (NT)
*** 27 books
*** Primarily written in Greek
***Some newer manuscripts have also been found in Aramaic
*** Main flow of the NT "Story"
**** Describes the coming of Elohim’s solution to man’s ultimate problem in the pers of Jesus Christ, the Messiah
**** Messiah / Christ - The Anointed One
**** Fulfils everything promised in the Old Testament
**** Thus the new and the old form a unity
**** Describes the lives of the first people who were redeemed
**** Ends with a prophetic picture of the end this age and the beginning of a wonderful eternity where the redeemed as Christ’s Bride live in perfect harmony with Elohim…

=== Jesus Christ the Foundation of the Christian Faith
==== Believer’s life the construction of a Building
* Examples:
** Jude vs. 20
** 1 Corinthians 3:9-10
** Ephesians 2:22
** Acts 20:32
* Natural Order - You first need to lay a foundation before you can build
** Spiritual order is similar
* You can only support a small building on a weak foundation
** Similarly, a strong foundation can support larger buildings
* Many christians struggle with the following:
** Start off with grand plans,
*** but because they do not build a strong foundation,
*** their building ends up in a heap of ruins (unanswered, prayers, vows and intentions unfulfilled…)
*** The real problem lies beneath the ruins
**** A poor foundation was laid
* My Testimony
** I have been following Jesus for many years now, but I must admit when I look back I did not build a strong foundation
** I spent a lot of time doing things for Elohim, and I built my life in a very haphazard, sporadic, Bedouin way
** I was very unstable accordingly and my life was filled with doubt
** I should have spent more time building a strong foundation
*** instead of trying to always be the big spiritual leader...
**** present at every event,
**** always looking to pioneer something new etc.

==== Christ the Rock
* Accordingly, we should ask ourselves the following question…
** What is Elohim’s appointed foundation on which we should build our christian life?
* Jesus Christ is the foundation!
** 1 Corinthians 3:11
** 1 Peter 2:6
*** Isaiah 28:16 (showing the Old & New Testament agree in this fact)
* Nothing else can be the foundation!
** Creeds
** Denominations
** Traditions
** Church
** Ordinance
** Ceremony
* Matthew 16:13-18
** Some mistakenly believe Jesus is saying He will build his Church upon Peter
*** This is nonsense!
*** Petros - small rock
*** Peter was just a man with many failings even though a charismatic, born leader
**** Matthew 16:22-23 - Get behind me satan
**** Denied the Lord 3 times
**** Galatians 2:11-14 - Separated himself because of the fear of the Judaizers
*** Rather consider…
**** Psalm 18:2 - The Lord is my rock
**** Psalm 62 - He only is my rock and my salvation
***** Rock - 3 times
***** Salvation - 4 times
**** ONLY - Only the Lord!
**** Acts 4:12 - Peter himself says,”Nor is there salvation in any other…”

==== How do we build on Jesus the rock?
* 4 Stages seen in Matthew 16:16
** Confrontation
*** You need a definite, personal experience with Jesus
*** No mediator or any other human being playing a go between
*** No basing your faith on someone’s nice ideas, emotions etc.
*** Testimony
**** When I was 7 years old I attended a School for children at a Rhema conference where they told me about Jesus and what he had done for me. This was not the first time I had heard about Jesus, but this time I really felt I needed to respond to the message. I remember, later at home, holding this pamphlet in my hands with a picture of Jesus on the cross and appreciating what Jesus had done for me as well as being in a repentant state
**** I also remember a dream one night where Jesus came on a chariot to fetch people and he spoke to me and said one day He would come and fetch me, but in the meantime I was to commit myself to His Word!
** Revelation
** Acknowledgement
** Confession
