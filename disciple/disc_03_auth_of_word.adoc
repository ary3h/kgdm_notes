== The Word's Authority

=== Introduction
* John 10:34-36
* Title for the Bible
** The Word of God
*** jesus was saying the truths revelaed are not form man, but from God
*** Men are only channels
* The Scripture

=== The Bible as God's written Word
* The scripture reveals a constraint
** That which is written
** Does not contain the entirety of what God has done, all of His thoughts, purpose etc. in every detail
** Also doesn't contain all the divinely inspired messages
*** Bible states this (John... if all that jesus did was recorded...)
* Bible is completely true and authoritative, but highly selective
* Message primarily for the human race
* Scripture cannot be broken
** Jesus sets approval upon its claims for supreme and divine authority
* Men were only channels when they wrote these books
** These days we are able to control satelllites millions of miles away with radio waves we cannot see
*** Only people with the most unscientific minds would reject the idea God could not do this with His creation
* The Bible clearly describes how God controlled, directed and communciated with the people who wrote the scriptures
** 2 Timothy 3:16 - through the Holy Spirit
*** By inspiration - means literally "inbreathed of God" - connected with word Spirit
** 2 Peter 1:20-21
*** "Moved by" - "Borne along by / Directed in their course by"
* Psalm 12:6
** Furnace - human vessel
** Silver tried 7 times - absolute perfection of the Holy Spirit's Wortk
