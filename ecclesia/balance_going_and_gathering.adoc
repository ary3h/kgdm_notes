== Balancing, going and gathering

=== Background
* These days it seems most Churches are more focused on gathering people
** Instead of equipping and sending
* Is this bad or is our perspective incorrect?

=== Options
* Rather focus on training & releasing healthy leaders (Fathers & Mothers) in the Ecclesia
** Mature Mothers and Fathers will naturally go out to start new Healthy Ecclesia Families
