=== Sermon: A call to repentance (2023-11)

==== Where are we?
* Previously
** Spoke on the importance of God's Word
** Apart from a list of many benefits and that it is the basis for our faith
** I wanted everyone to understand that it is a prerequisite to faith
** We can only have faith in that we can believe in what YHWH has spoken
*** Faith is a response to what YHWH has said
*** With the spoken Word we have nothing to believe in and have faith in

==== Repentance in the Church
* Many think we need to be more like the prophets of Baal screaming and crying to Get God's attention! More meetings, more all night this etc.
* We need to truly repent and get back to the main thing
* YHWH wants a people with a wineskin that is prepared for heaven
* We need to repent and learn his ways

==== Repentance of Joylessness
* Read the last 10 psalms and the in particlular the last Psalm
* Its about praising the Lord radically
* We should be ashamed that we don't celebrate Jesus in a way that makes Ibiza look boring

==== Repentance from Rebellion
* In the West we have a culture of rebellion that is so pervasive even the Church doesn't understand authority anymore...

==== But I don't know what to repent of
* Start Studying the Word and ask the Lord
* Adopt a lifestyle of repentance
** You will never "arrive"
