==== 2022: Dream of Revival in Lippe

I was at a Sunday night service with my family at Wa Neu Church, but it was in the region of Lippe.
Crg Ell was there and I asked him why? He said he had moved here and loved it!
Then the guy preaching said, but actually Jesus said, "People will come here from all over the World to drink!"
In the same way we have these healing springs here at Bad Salzuflen and Bad Oeynhausen the Lord will start a movement here
where people will come and drink of Him!
