== Genesis

=== Genesis 1

==== Overview / Notes
* The Spirit always acts on the Word be spoken.
* It is the same with everything in life for the believer.
* As the believer speaks the Word of God in Faith, the believer is speaking what is spoken into existence.

==== Work
* Elohim himself works in creation
* Personally involved (Ruach + Word) - doesn't work at a distance

* YHWH sets the stars and planets in the sky as signs to mark seasons, days years
** Helpful for man to be able to plan work based on times and seasons
** Are you tired and burnt out because you are not aligning with the rhythmes of life that YHWH put in place?
** These days so many people struggle with burnout and other related illnesses.
** YHWH originally created seasons and rhythms for life that the modern world has forgotten and ignored.
** It’s time for us to come back to His rhythms.

* Mankind's main purpose is to be the image of YHWH and to...
** have dominion over the created order
** Be fruitful
** Multiply - Fill the earth
** Subdue it
*** When YHWH said mankind should have dominion over the earth and subdue it, He was implying it would devolve into chaos without mankind.
*** Don’t be fooled by people who say mankind is a disease that needs to be eradicated from the earth… the earth needs human beings to work properly and to align with YHWH’s plan for it!
*** YHWH created man to make earth function and look like heaven.

=== Genesis 2

==== Work
* YHWH Rests on the 7th day
* Sets a pattern in place for mankind and the created order to rest each week

* Tending the garden
** YHWH sets mankind in a garden and asks them to tend it
** This is an ideal picture of work

* Naming the animals & birds
** The person who can name a thing has authority over a thing

* It's not good for man to be alone
** Remember that YHWH made us to be a part of a team
** It's not healthy for us to be alone, to work alone etc.
** We need other people in our lives with whom we can partner in the work YHWH has prepared for us
** Ask YHWH to bring these people into your life and learn to work in a team
