Father God, I come to you in the Name of Jesus, declaring that no weapon that is formed against us shall prosper and every tongue which rises against us in judgement we do condemn.
This is our heritage as servants of the Lord and our righteousness is from You, O Lord of Hosts (Isaiah 54:17).
If there are those who
have been speaking or praying against us or who have rejected us, even cursed us, we forgive them and,
having forgiven them, we bless them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ (Matthew 5:43, Romans 12:14).
Now we declare, O Lord, that You and You alone are our God, and besides You there is no other God. You
are a just God and Saviour: You are Creator, Redeemer, Faithful, Loving God. You are Father, Jesus the Son
and Holy Spirit – and we worship You!
Your Word says: “Submit yourself to God, resist the devil, and he will flee from you.” So we submit
ourselves afresh to You in unreserved obedience. Having submitted to You, Lord, we do as Your Word
directs. We resist the devil: all his pressures, his attacks, his deceptions, every instrument or agent he would
seek to use against us. We do not submit! We resist him, drive him from us and exclude him from us in the
Name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Specifically we reject and repel:
• Every form of witchcraft. Every influence of the occult.
• Every spirit of infirmity: infections, malignancies, viruses, pain, inflammation, and allergies.
• Every spirit of depression and heaviness; confusion and deception.
• Every spirit of accusation and condemnation.
Thank You, Father, that You confuse the plans the enemy has against us.
Finally, Lord, we thank You that through the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross, we have passed out from under
the curse and entered into the blessing of Abraham, whom You blessed in all things
(Galatians 3:13-14, Genesis 24:1).
Thank You for Your favour, Your presence, Your provision, Your protection. Thank You for good health,
victory, exaltation, reproductiveness, and prosperity.
